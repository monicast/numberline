# numberline
Silly bash game

## How to play

The game will look something like this 

0    59677   

- The first number will increment with every press of the 'w' key and then wrap back to 0. This is called the 'counter'
- The long string of digits, known as the 'numberline' will gradually grow unless the player increments the counter to a digit matching at least one of the digits in number line and the spacebar is depressed. This will delete all matching digits in the numberline.
- The game ends when the numberline touches the counnt
